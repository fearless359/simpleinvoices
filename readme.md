***Making invoicing rock since '05***

## Cloning
*Note: Cloning is not necessary unless you wish to contribute to the ongoing development and maintenance of SI.*
For versions prior to Fearless359 Release, SI uses **gitsubmodules** to load the Zend Framework.  
When cloning the repository use the `--recursive` option to ensure that Zend is retrieved.  
`git clone --recursive git@github.com:simpleinvoices/simpleinvoices.git`

For the Fearless359 releases, Zend Framework is incorporated in the download.
