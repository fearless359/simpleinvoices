This extension will put in the HTML head:

The contents of templates/default/css/css-map.tpl, if exists, (exchanging {$csspath} for the path automatically.
Otherwise if that file is not found, each css file in templates/default/css/ is linked as an external css.
(The HTML head contains a hook name $hook_head_link that is used for the above.)
(eg. All CSS files in extensions/abc/templates/default/css/ will be put in the HTML head, if the extension is enabled.)

In each extension directory, if the current view css file exists within templates/default/ in the current module directory,
that files's contents will be loaded into the HTML head as an inline style sheet.
(The HTML head contains a hook name $hook_head_instyle that is used for the above.)
(eg. The file extensions/abc/templates/default/xxx/yyy.css will be put inline in the HTML head, if the extension is enabled,
and on the page "...index?module=xxx&view=yyy".)
